# Furniture Layout Optimization with Pelican Optimization Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements and benchmarks the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) for automated furniture layout in constraint-based interior spaces. It provides a head-to-head comparison with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on realistic room scenarios.

**Features:**
- Full source code for POA, GA, and PSO layout optimization
- Visualizations in 2D (matplotlib) and interactive 3D (Plotly)
- Reproducible experimental runs and statistical reports
- Output and sample run included

---
The Repo contains a .py and an .ipynb file; the .py file can be used directly in Colab or Conda

---
## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- scipy
- plotly

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### UPDATE:

We removed the warning **FigureCanvasAgg is non-interactive and thus cannot be shown.**. It was a library warning and was not directly related to our code.
