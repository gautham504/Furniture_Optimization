# Furniture Layout Optimization with Pelican Optimization Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements and benchmarks the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) for automated furniture layout in constraint-based interior spaces. It provides a head-to-head comparison with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on realistic room scenarios.

**Features:**
- Full source code for POA, GA, and PSO layout optimization
- Visualizations in 2D (matplotlib) and interactive 3D (Plotly)
- Reproducible experimental runs and statistical reports
- Output and sample run included
